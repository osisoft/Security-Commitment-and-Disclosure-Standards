# Security Commitment and Disclosure Standards

## Our commitment

The PI System often serves as a barrier protecting control system networks and mission-critical infrastructure assets. We are committed to (1) delivering a high-quality product and (2) communicating clearly what security issues have been addressed. New releases of products are tested and scored to ensure the highest quality and to provide the most secure versions released to date. Our commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further.  

## Vulnerability communication

The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered vulnerabilities is consistent with the [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Process](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) from the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency. Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, we are sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection.

For more information, refer to the [Ethical Disclosure policy](https://www.aveva.com/en/legal/osisoft-terms-and-conditions/osisoft-ethical-disclosure/).

To report a security vulnerability, refer to the [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://www.aveva.com/en/legal/osisoft-terms-and-conditions/report-security/) form.  

## Vulnerability scoring

We have selected the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. To calculate the CVSS scores, we use the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) calculator maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We use Critical, High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This removes some of the opinion-related errors of CVSS scoring. As noted in the [CVSS specification](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document), base scores range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity.
