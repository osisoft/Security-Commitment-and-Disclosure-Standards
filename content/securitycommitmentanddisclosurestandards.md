# Security Commitment and Disclosure Standards

## Our commitment

The PI System often serves as a barrier protecting control system networks and mission-critical infrastructure assets. For this reason, AVEVA is committed to delivering a high-quality product, and communicating any security issues addressed in a clear, concise manner.  

New releases of products are tested and scored to ensure the highest quality and to provide the most secure versions released to date. AVEVA's commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further.  

## Vulnerability communication

The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered security vulnerabilities is consistent with the [Common Industrial Control System Vulnerability Disclosure Framework](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/ICSJWG-Archive/ICSJWG_Vulnerability_Disclosure_Framework_Final_1.pdf) developed by the [Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Industrial-Control-Systems-Joint-Working-Group-ICSJWG). Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, AVEVA is sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection.  

For more information, refer to the [Ethical Disclosure Policy](https://www.aveva.com/en/legal/osisoft-terms-and-conditions/osisoft-ethical-disclosure/). To report a security vulnerability, refer to the [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://www.aveva.com/en/legal/osisoft-terms-and-conditions/report-security/) form.  

## Vulnerability scoring

AVEVA has selected the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. AVEVA uses the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) calculator maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to calculate severity scores, and assigns each vulnerability to Critical, High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This process removes some of the opinion-related errors of CVSS scoring. As noted in the [CVSS specification](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document), base scores range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity.
